# Omaview

A fork of [Omawrite](https://github.com/omacom-io/omawrite) that adds a live preview pane
with LaTeX math rendered by KaTeX, next to Omawrite's distraction-free editor.
It is a dead-simple Markdown writing app built with Qt Quick and C++ that
automatically follows system dark/light mode.

> **Status:** early fork. The preview is being built; see [`docs/SPEC.md`](docs/SPEC.md)
> for the specification and milestones. Upstream is tracked as the `upstream` remote.
> Development status, code layout and project rules are in [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Install

Build and install locally with `bin/install` (requires `makepkg`), or just build with
`bin/build` and run `build/omaview`. Tests: `bin/test`.

## Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+S` saves. Unsaved documents use the XDG desktop portal file picker.
- `Ctrl+Shift+S` saves as.
- `Ctrl+O` opens a Markdown file through the portal picker.
- `Ctrl+P` opens the system print dialog.
- `Ctrl+E` shows or hides the preview window. Closing the preview window only hides it.
- `Ctrl+N` opens a new Omaview window.
- `Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+Shift+Z`, and `Ctrl+Y` handle undo and redo.
- `Super+F` toggles fullscreen. Qt maps this key as `Meta+F`.
- `Ctrl+F` searches the document. Use `Enter` or `Ctrl+G` for the next match and `Shift+Enter` for the previous match.
- `Ctrl+H` opens find and replace.
- `Ctrl+B`, `Ctrl+I`, and `Ctrl+K` insert bold, italic, and link Markdown.
- `Ctrl+?` shows the keyboard shortcut reference.

Unsaved drafts are recovered after an abnormal exit. Omaview also watches open files
and warns before an external change can replace local work.

Text follows the desktop text size — `omarchy display text size`, or GNOME's
`text-scaling-factor` — and re-flows without a restart. The default of 12px leaves
Omaview at the size it is designed around; larger and smaller sizes scale from there.

## Requirements

- Qt 6: `qt6-base`, `qt6-declarative`, `qt6-quickcontrols2`
- `xdg-desktop-portal` and a portal backend
